let c;
let a = 34;
let b = 21;

console.log(a + b) //first expression
// The expression will return 55 because a is a number and b is un number too:
// 55:

a = 2;

console.log(a + b)//second expression
// The expression will return 23 because a is a number and b is un number too:
// 23:

//1-What will be the outcome of a + b in the first expression 
// The expression will return 55 because a is a number and b is un number too:

//2-What will be the outcome of a + b in the second expression ?
// The expression will return 23 because a is a number and b is un number too:

//3-What is the value of c
//Value of c is undefined because c has nos value

//4-Analyse the code below, what will be the outcome?
console.log(3 + 4 + '5');
//The result will be 75 because 3+4 = 7 and 7+'5' return 75 because of '5' who is a string
